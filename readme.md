MasterStudy LMS Video Monitor. 

Problem: With MasterStudy LMS, students can just skip over video lessons without actually going through the material. 

Solution: This WordPress Plugin ensures that students go through all the video lessons by preventing students from forward skipping and also from clicking the next button.
